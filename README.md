# Repository_logs_elexir

This project entails developing a system that collects logs from various machines, allowing users to query and filter the logs, as well as subscribe to specific users to receive logs from them in real-time. The architecture is based on the Elixir language with a repository pattern. Additionally, a frontend has been built using the Phoenix framework along with Tailwind CSS for styling.
